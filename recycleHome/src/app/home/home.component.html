            According to a study by Eunomia, Louisiana ranked 49th out of the 50 states 
            in recycling efforts at only a 4% recycling rate. The Lafayette Recycling 
            Initiative is a citywide project geared towards raising that rate and increasing 
            recycling throughout Lafayette.

            The Lafayette Recycling Initiative offers information on the city of Lafayetteâ€™s 
            municipal recycling collection. We also provide information on recycling drop-off 
            locations. These drop-off locations are used by all Louisiana residents and visitors.
