<font size="+1">According to a study by Eunomia, Louisiana ranked 49th out of the 50 states in recycling efforts at only a 4% recycling rate. The Lafayette Recycling Initiative is a citywide project geared towards raising that rate and increasing recycling throughout Lafayette.</font>
<br>
<br>
<font size="+1">The Lafayette Recycling Initiative offers information on the city of Lafayetteâ€™s municipal recycling collection. We also provide information on recycling drop-off locations. These drop-off locations are used by all Louisiana residents and visitors.</font>
<br>
<br>
<font size="+1">We also have the Lafayette Recycling Initiative rewards program! This program is a collaboration with local sponsors that rewards residents for engaging in the Lafayette Recycling Initiative collection program. Earn points for recycling and creating a cleaner Lafayette tomorrow.</font>
